## Overview

This Todo App showcases the capabilities of Chromia's blockchain platform in building decentralized applications. By utilizing the Rell programming language for backend logic and integrating MetaMask for authentication, the app ensures secure, blockchain-based data storage and seamless user interactions. With a modern, responsive design built using Nuxt.js and Tailwind CSS, users can easily manage their tasks while enjoying the benefits of decentralized technology, including real-time updates and data integrity.

## Features

- üîê MetaMask Authentication
- ‚úèÔ∏è Create, Read, Update, and Delete Todos and update Username
- üîÑ Search for Todos and sort them along with task overview
- üì± Responsive Design
- üé® Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- ‚õìÔ∏è Blockchain-based Data Storage

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v16 or higher)
- [PostgreSQL](https://docs.chromia.com/intro/installation/) (Reccomended within docker)
- [Chromia CLI](https://docs.chromia.com/intro/installation/)
- [MetaMask Browser Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en)
- [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation)


## Installation

### 1. Blockchain Setup

First, set up the Chromia blockchain:

In a new terminal

```bash
# Navigate to the blockchain directory
cd backend

# Install Chromia files
chr install

# Start your postgres database (instruction uses inside docker)

dockerd
docker start postgres

# Start the chain
chr node start

```

### 2. Frontend Setup

In a new terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# install font

pnpm install @vercel/fonts


# Start the development server
pnpm run dev
```

## Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Connect with wallet" to connect with MetaMask or Connect with MetaMask button
3. Sign the authentication transaction when prompted
4. After successful authentication, you'll be redirected to the todo page
5. Start creating and managing your todos!

## How It Works

The application works through the following flow:
1. Users connect their MetaMask wallet for authentication
2. Todo data is stored on the Chromia blockchain, ensuring decentralization and data integrity
3. The frontend communicates with the blockchain through the REST API port it will be running on the port number 7740
5. All transactions are signed using MetaMask and recorded on the blockchain

## Additional Information

No Session Storage: Due to time constraints, the app does not store session data, as I was unable to find a solution for persistent sessions. As a result, every time the page is refreshed, users are redirected to the home page. However, the app uses the key stored in local storage to avoid prompting users to reconnect their wallet via the MetaMask extension after a refresh.

Learning and Building in One Week: I joined the program late, leaving me with only one week to learn the Rell language. Despite this, I successfully learned Rell and used it to build this app. In addition to completing the core functionality, I also added extra features beyond the original requirements, showcasing my ability to quickly learn and implement new technologies.
